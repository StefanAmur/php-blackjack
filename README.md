# PHP OOP Blackjack Game

## The mission

Let's make a game in PHP: Blackjack! A game of chance and luck!

To keep the code structured for this complicated game, we are going to use classes and objects.

Your coach has provided you with some starter classes that you can use for the game, to help you out on your first OOP challenge. First spent some time reading these classes and really understand what they are doing. If something in the syntax is unclear, google it first and then ask your coach.

If this is still an unclear subject for you don't feel bad to google some basic OOP articles, or ask your coach. it is normal this feels difficult, because object oriented programming is a really complex subject!

## Assignment duration and type

We had 2Ô∏è‚É£ days to complete it (28/10 - 29/10) and it was a solo exercise  
Note: Any number next to ‚úî or ‚ùå means in which day I considered the feature/todo resolved or in which day I tackeled it

## Instructions / To do

1. ‚úî <b>:one:</b> Create a class called `Player` in the file `Player.php`
2. ‚úî :one: Add 2 private properties:
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `cards` (array)
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `lost` (bool, default=false)
3. Add a couple of empty public methods to this class:
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `hit`
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `surrender`
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `getScore`
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `hasLost`
4. ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a class called `Blackjack` in the file `Blackjack.php`
5. ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add 3 private properties (to the `Blackjack` class)
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `player` (Player)
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `dealer` (Player for now)
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `deck` (Deck)
6. Add the following public methods:
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `getPlayer` (returns the `player` object)
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `getDealer` (returns the `dealer` object)
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `getDeck` (returns the `deck` object)
7. In the constructor (of `Blackjack` class) do the following:
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Instantiate the Player twice, insert it into the `player` property and a `dealer` property
   - üôè Create a new `deck` object (code for this was already written for us üôè)
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Shuffle the cards with `shuffle()` method on deck
8. In the constructor of `Player` class:
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ ü§î Make it expect the `Deck` object as a parameter
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ ü§î Pass this `Deck` from the `Blackjack` constructor
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Now draw 2 cards for the player. You have to use an existing method for this from the Deck class
9. Go back to the `Player` class and add the following logic in your empty methods:

   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `getScore` loops over all the cards and returns the total value of that player
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `hasLost` will return the bool of the lost property
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `hit` should add a card to the player. If this brings him above 21, set the `lost` property to `true`. To count his score use the method `getScore` you wrote earlier. This method should expect the `$deck` variable as an argument from outside, to draw the card.
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ `surrender` should make you surrender the game (Dealer wins). This sets the property `lost` in the `player` instance to true.
   - üôè `stand` does not have a method in the player class but will instead call hit on the `dealer` instance. (you have to do nothing here) üôè

## Creating the index.php file

1. ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create an index.php file with the following code:

   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Require all the files with the classes you already created.
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the PHP Session
   - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ If the session does not have a `Blackjack` variable yet:
     - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new `Blackjack` object
     - ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Put the `Blackjack` object in the session

2. ‚úî 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use buttons or links to send to the `index.php` page what the player's action is (hit, stand or surrender)

### Captain's log, end of day 1

> Most of the day was spent reading about OOP on php.net or w3schools.com or wherever I could find explanations on how it works and so on. The already included classes and example were very helpful.  
> However, I'm not 100% sure that I'm doing things the right way or if it will even work.  
> I have used the almighty `var_dump` and it does look like it does work in some way, shape or form.  
> Also, Xdebug shows something is there so...

I hope this means something is working as it should so far....
